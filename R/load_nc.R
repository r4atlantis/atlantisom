#' Load Atlantis outputfiles (netcdf)
#'
#' This function loads Atlantis outputfiles (any netcdf file) and
#' converts them to a \code{data.frame}.
#' @template dir
#' @template file_nc
#' @template bps
#' @template fgs
#' @param select_groups Character vector of funtional groups to select.
#'   Names have to match the ones used in the ncdf file, and therefore must
#'   be in the column \code{"Name"} in the \code{fgs}.
#' @param select_variable A character value spefifying which variable to return.
#'   loaded. Only one variable of the options available (i.e., \code{c(
#'   "N", "Nums", "ResN", "StructN", "Eat", "Growth", "Prodn", "Grazing")
#'   }) can be loaded at a time.
#' @param remove_bboxes A logical, specifying if boundary boxes should be excluded.
#'   The default value is \code{TRUE}.
#' @param check_acronyms A logical, specifying if selected groups are active
#'   in the model run. This is used in automated runs.
#'   All groups are passed when plotting is called via batch-file,
#'   (which cannot be changed easily) this will result in errors if some
#'   groups are not active in the model run. By default this argument is \code{TRUE}.
#' @param bboxes A numeric vector specifying the boundary boxes.
#'   Note this does not neet to include islands, as the presence of islands will
#'   automatically be determined inside the \code{load_nc} function. The default is
#'   a vector of length one, which includes \code{c(0)}, because Atlantis must be
#'   configured to always have the first box be a boundary box. One can use
#'   \code{\link{load_box}} and \code{\link{get_boundary}}.
#' @family load functions
#' @return A \code{data.frame} in long format with the following coumn names:
#'   Species, timestep, polygon, agecl, and atoutput (i.e., variable).
